ABOUT AINAD
===========

AINAD is the initials of AINAD Is Not A Distro. It is a simple
script that installs a series of applications and packages that create a
minimal graphical environment ready to be used on Arch Linux.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This project is in its early stages of development and it
isn't production ready.

------------------------------------------------------------------------



WHY AINAD IS NOT A DISTRO
=========================

Because it is simply a script that automates the installation and
configuration of a minimal graphical environment for Arch Linux, and
that is it. This was created for particular use, but was opened to
anyone that want to try it.

At the end of the installation, the user will just be using Arch Linux
and not some random distro maintained by a random person.

-   AINAD is not, and does not intend to be, a Linux distro;
-   It is just an automated package installer that creates a minimal and
    usable graphical environment for the user. It does nothing more than
    what the user could do by just running some commands manually;
-   It does not guarantee that all things will work after the
    installation. Your hardware is different than mine. Bug reports are
    welcome. It is tested for basic uses, with common hardware;
-   It also does not guarantee user support.



WHICH PACKAGES ARE INSTALLED
============================

AINAD uses the Arch Linux package manager Pacman and the package
manager of the community Yay to install the programs. AINAD users
the official repositories of Arch Linux and the user repositories of
Arch Linux, the AUR.



-   REFLECTOR

    Packages : reflector

    Utility that keeps the mirror list up to date.

----------------------------------------

-   XORG

    Packages : xorg-server xorg-xev xorg-xinput

    The good old Xorg server is the backend that draws the graphical
    environment on the screen of the user.

    - Why not Waylad?

    Wayland still has some incompatibilities with NVidia proprietary GPU
    drivers. AINAD does not intend to be as up-to-date as possible, its
    goal is to be stable, functional, and Xorg, in this case, is the
    best choice for now. Also, AINAD installs Openbox as window
    manager, which does not have an Wayland version.

----------------------------------------

-   SDDM

    Packages :
    sddm noto-fonts qt5-graphicaleffects qt5-quickcontrols2

    SDDM is a beautiful and lightweight login manager. It allows the
    user to log into the computer through a pleasant and user-friendly
    visual.

    Along with SDDM, the Noto fonts and some QT5 packages, necessary for
    the theme [Sugar Candy de Marian
    Arlt](https://framagit.org/MarianArlt/sddm-sugar-candy), are
    installed.

----------------------------------------

-   KERNEL HEADERS

    Packages : linux-headers

    The Linux headers work as an interface between the Kernel components
    and the userland. Some libraries, such as sys-libs and glibc,
    uses the Kernel headers. Other programs also use this package, but
    don't end up not putting it as a dependency. Because of that, it is
    good to have it installed by default. You can read more about it at
    <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Linux-headers>.

----------------------------------------

-   OPENBOX

    Packages : openbox

    Openbox is an extremely stable and lightweight window manager.
    Basically it communicates with Xorg to draw the windows and its
    contents on the screen.

----------------------------------------

-   XDOTOOL

    Packages : xdotool

    commands.

----------------------------------------

-   MAN - MANUAL INTERFACE

    for many applications. It is good to have it installed because it is
    pretty default on many Linux installations.

----------------------------------------

-   PHP

    Packages : php php-intl php-sqlite

    I know, I know, you don't like PHP, but I do, and I use it in all
    AINAD utilities.

    - Why not the programming language X Y Z? Or just simple Bash
    scripts?

    Because I probably don't know programming language X Y Z, or have
    little knowledge about it. I know a lot of PHP, so, that is it.

    I also use many of Bash scripts, but for some things it can be a
    pain in the ass to deal with, so, yeah, I mainly use PHP...
