# ABOUT AINAD

AINAD is the initials of **AINAD Is Not A Distro**. It is a simple script that installs a series of applications and packages that create a minimal graphical environment ready to be used on Arch Linux.

1. Run the following command:
    ```
    (source <(curl -L https://andregalastri.com.br/ainadinstall))
    ```
    > **ATTENTION:<br /> An internet connection is required.**
1. Choose your language;
1. Choose the option 1, inform your SUDO/ROOT password and wait the end of the installation.

<br />

# WHY AINAD IS NOT A DISTRO

Because it is simply a script that automates the installation and configuration of a minimal graphical environment for Arch Linux, and *that is it*. This was created for particular use, but was opened to anyone that want to try it.

At the end of the installation, the user will just be using Arch Linux and not some random distro maintained by a random person.

* AINAD is not, and does not intend to be, a Linux distro;
* It is just an automated package installer that creates a minimal and usable graphical environment for the user. It does nothing more than what the user could do by just running some commands manually;
* It does not guarantee that all things will work after the installation. Your hardware is different than mine. Bug reports are welcome. It is tested for basic uses, with common hardware;
* It also does not guarantee user support.

<br />

# WHICH PACKAGES ARE INSTALLED

AINAD uses the Arch Linux package manager **Pacman** and the package manager of the community **Yay** to install the programs. AINAD users the official repositories of Arch Linux and the user repositories of Arch Linux, the **AUR**.

<br />

* **XORG**

    *Packages* : `xorg-server xorg-xev`

    The good old **Xorg** server is the backend that draws the graphical environment on the screen of the user.
  
    **- Why not Waylad?**
 
    Wayland still has some incompatibilities with NVidia proprietary GPU drivers. AINAD does not intend to be as up-to-date as possible, its goal is to be stable, functional, and Xorg, in this case, is the best choice for now. Also, AINAD installs **Openbox** as window manager, which does not have an Wayland version.

<br />

* **SDDM**

    *Packages* : `sddm noto-fonts qt5-graphicaleffects qt5-quickcontrols2`

    **SDDM** is a beautiful and lightweight login manager. It allows the user to log into the computer through a pleasant and user-friendly visual.

    Along with SDDM, the Noto fonts and some QT5 packages, necessary for the theme [Sugar Candy de Marian Arlt](https://framagit.org/MarianArlt/sddm-sugar-candy), are installed.

<br />

* **KERNEL HEADERS**

    *Packages* : `linux-headers`

    The Linux headers work as an interface between the Kernel components and the userland. Some libraries, such as *sys-libs* and *glibc*, uses the Kernel headers. Other programs also use this package, but don't end up not putting it as a dependency. Because of that, it is good to have it installed by default. You can read more about it at [https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Linux-headers](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Linux-headers).
    
<br />

* **OPENBOX**

    *Packages* : `openbox`

    **Openbox** is an extremely stable and lightweight window manager. Basically it communicates with Xorg to draw the windows and its contents on the screen. 

<br />

* **XDOTOOL**

    *Packages* : `xdotool`

    Utility that allows the automation of hotkeys and mouse via terminal commands.

<br />

* **MAN - MANUAL INTERFACE**

    *Packages* : `man-db`

    An terminal interface that allows the user to read reference manuals for many applications. It is good to have it installed because it is pretty default on many Linux installations.
    
<br />

* **PHP**

    *Packages* : `php php-intl php-sqlite`

    I know, I know, you don't like PHP, but I do, and I use it in all AINAD utilities.

    **- Why not the _programming language X Y Z_? Or just simple Bash scripts?**
 
    Because I probably don't know _programming language X Y Z_, or have little knowledge about it. I know a lot of PHP, so, that is it.
    
    I also use many of Bash scripts, but for some things it can be a pain in the ass to deal with, so, yeah, I mainly use PHP...
    
<br />

* **WMCTRL**

    *Packages* : `wmctrl`

    Allows to control windows, as well capture related data, via terminal commands.
    
<br />
